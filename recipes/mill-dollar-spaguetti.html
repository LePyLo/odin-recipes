        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
        until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.

        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5
        to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Transfer to a bowl and mix spaghetti sauce into ground beef.
